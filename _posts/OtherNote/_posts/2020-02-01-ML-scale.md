normalization and standardization are sometimes used interchangeably, but they usually refer to different things. Normalization usually means to scale a variable to have a values between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.

# Normalization 

$$\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$$  

$$\bar{x}$$和$$s$$通过样本估计的均值和方差  

标准化数据的均值为0，方差为1   


# standardization  

$$\frac{X-X_{min}}{X_{max}-X_{min}}$$  

标准化数据的取值范围[0,1]   

# Mean-subtraction and zero-centering  

$$x-\bar{x}$$

标准化数据具有对称的特征，中心点为零
